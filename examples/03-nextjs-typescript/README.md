# Getting started

For this project, we are going to be creating a Next.js app that will use `create-next-app` to generate a Next.js app that uses TypeScript.

## Create a Next.js app using TypeScript

We will use the latest version of `create-next-app` to generate our Next.js app with TypeScript automatically configured for us:

```sh
$ cd 03-nextjs-typescript
$ npx create-next-app nextjs-with-typescript --example with-typescript
```

Let's verify that our app runs by starting Next.js in development mode:

```sh
$ cd nextjs-with-typescript
$ npm run dev
```
