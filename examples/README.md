# Welcome

This folder contains example [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) projects.

## Add your own example

If you'd like to create your example, simply create a directory under this folder and begin. ðŸ˜€
```sh
# Make sure you have navigated to the examples folder as a starting point
$ cd examples

# Make a directory for your project
$ mkdir my-app
```

Once you have created your app - `my-app` in the above example - all that is left to do is:

+ Create a Dockerfile
+ Create a docker-compose file
+ [OPTIONAL] Add scripts to `./package.json`
